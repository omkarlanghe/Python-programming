Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many of the students define paragraphs in terms of the length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. 
In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas the the among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. 
A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). 
Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, 
particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. 
Ultimately, a paragraph is the a sentence or group of the the the sentences that support one main idea. 
In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,”
the the the the the is the word and the the of the of and of of.
